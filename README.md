## Traffic Sign Recognition Program

### Overview
This model uses deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. The model will be trained on traffic signs from the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). A training set, validation set and testing set were used. The testing set was keeped seperate and untouched until after the model was completed. The model had an accuracy of 94% on the testing set. 


### How to view
The report can be viewed by clicking the notebook [Traffic_Signs_Recognition.ipynb](https://github.com/bkapsalis/predict_traffic_signs_from_images/blob/master/Traffic_Signs_Recognition.ipynb) above. 

Also, later after I learnd Keras I rewrote the model with Keras code. This model can be viewed by clicking [traffic-sign-classification-with-keras.ipynb](https://github.com/bkapsalis/predict_traffic_signs_from_images/blob/master/traffic-sign-classification-with-keras.ipynb) above. The test accuracy increased to 95.9%
