## Traffic Sign Recognition Program

### Overview

This model uses deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. The model will be trained on traffic signs from the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). A training set, validation set and testing set were used. The testing set was keeped seperate and untouche until after the model was completed. The model had an accuracy of 94% on the testing set.
